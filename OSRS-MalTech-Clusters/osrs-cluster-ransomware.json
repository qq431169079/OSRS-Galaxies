The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-20250, was discovered by experts at Check Point in February, it could allow an attacker to gain control of the target system. The flaw is an “Absolute Path Traversal” issue in the library that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code by using a specially-crafted file archive. The JNEC.a ransomware also drops a ransom note (JNEC.README.TXT) on the infected computer to provide instructions on how to make the payment. JNEC.a is written in .NET, when the archive is decompressed it shows a corrupted image of a girl that triggers an error and shows an incomplete picture, meanwhile the ransomware is already delivered to the computer.",
