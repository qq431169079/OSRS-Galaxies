This actor was involved in the Indonesian hacking group “Indonesian Cyber Army.” Several websites were defaced by this group and tagged by DevilScreaM in 2012. DevilScreaM also created the site Newbie-Security.or.id, an Indonesian site of hacking tools frequented by members of the Indonesian Cyber Army. DevilScreaM stopped defacing websites and created an anti-malware product, ScreaMAV, for the Indonesian market. This white hat activity did not last. In mid-2013 they began defacing sites again and posting exploits on 0day.today mostly around WordPress vulnerabilities. DevilScreaM’s GitHub page contains various tools, including a PHP remote shell used on compromised websites as well as commits on the z1miner Monero (XMR) miner tool. in late 2017 DevilScreaM created the 16Shop phishing kit and set up a Facebook group to sell licenses and support. In November 2018. this private group had over 200 members. We checked the group in mid-June 2019 and it now has over 300 members and over 200 posts. Despite the questionable content, the group not only persists unchanged on social media, but continues to grow.",

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted INDRIK SPIDER millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware. In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.",

Currently, SWEED is actively targeting small and medium-sized companies around the world. Based on the TTPs used by this group, SWEED should be considered a relatively amateur actor. They use well-known vulnerabilities, commodity stealers and RATs (Pony, Formbook, UnknownRAT, Agent Tesla, etc.) and appear to rely on kits readily available on hacking forums. SWEED consistently leverages packing and crypting in order to minimize detection by anti-malware solutions. We assess that SWEED also does not have effective operational security, as they used several of the same online accounts for about five years, allowing for the discovery of a lot of their information, operations and associates.",

The threat actor shows similarities with other groups such as Magnallium and Chrysene, both active since at least 2017 and involved in attacks on oil and gas companies. Anyway, experts pointed out that the Hexane group has differed TTPs and has its own arsenal. Stylistically, the observed tradecraft resembles activity from groups such as COBALT GYPSY (which is related to OilRig, Crambus, and APT34) and COBALT TRINITY (also known as Elfin and APT33). However, none of the collected malware or infrastructure associated with LYCEUM has direct links to observed activity from these or other known threat groups. As of this publication, there is insufficient technical evidence to support an attribution assessment. When CTU researchers first published information about LYCEUM to Secureworks Threat Intelligence clients, no public documentation on the group existed.  Since then, reporting has emerged that refers to the threat group as HEXANE.",
