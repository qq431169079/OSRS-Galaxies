			"description": "Point-of-sale malware is popular among attackers, as it usually leads to them obtaining credit card numbers and immediately use that information for financial gain. This type of malware is generally deployed on retailers' websites and retail point-of-sale locations with the goal of tracking customers' payment information. If they successfully obtain credit card details, they can use either the proceeds from the sale of that information or use the credit card data directly to obtain additional exploits and resources for other malware. Point-of-sale terminals are often forgotten about in terms of segregation and can represent a soft target for attackers. Cisco Talos recently discovered a new PoS malware that the attackers are selling on a crimeware forum. Our researchers also discovered the associated payloads with the malware, its infrastructure and control panel. We assess with high confidence that this is not the first malware developed by this actor. A few years ago, they were also pushing the DiamondFox L!NK botnet. Known as GlitchPOS, this malware is also being distributed on alternative websites at a higher price than the original.",

In fact, the uptick of macro malware in the first half of 2018 was due to Powload, which was distributed via spam emails. Powload was also one of the most pervasive threats in the North American region in 2018, using various techniques to deliver payloads such as the information-stealing Emotet, Bebloh, and Ursnif. Our Powload detections and the number of related cases/incidents and unique samples we analyzed in 2018 also markedly increased compared to 2017. Powload’s evolving techniques, on the other hand, show how far it’ll go. While its use of spam email as a distribution method could be its constant, it has employed different ways of delivering payloads, from bypassing mitigations like a document’s preview mode to using fileless techniques and hijacking email accounts.",

These droppers are usually disguised as free games, utility applications or adult entertainment applications, yet contain an encrypted malicious payload. The dropper application then checks if any popular applications, such apps include WhatsApp, MXplayer, ShareIt and more from the attacker’s pre-determined list, are installed on the device. If any targeted application is found, Agent Smith will then attack those innocent applications at a later stage. In the second phase, after the dropper gains a foothold on victim device, it automatically decrypts the malicious payload into its original form – an APK (Android installation file) file which serves as the core part of Agent Smiths attack. The dropper then abuses several known system vulnerabilities to install the core malware without any user interaction at all. In the third phase, the core malware conducts attacks against each installed application on device which appears on its target list. The core malware quietly extracts a given innocent application’s APK file, patches it with extra malicious modules and finally abuses a further set of system vulnerabilities to silently swap the innocent version with a malicious one.",

These could be tools to circumvent internet censorship, such as Softether VPN 4.12 and psiphon3, or Microsoft Office activators. The dropper contains a tiny .NET shell that will wait for Windows shell commands from the operators. Using this and SMB shares on rented virtual private servers (VPS), the operators spread the next-stage modules using just net use and copy Windows shell commands. Lateral movements within the target infrastructure show how familiar the operators are with the IPv6 protocol. Along with IPv4 they use the newer version for shell commands and LAN addresses. The purpose of all this infrastructure and modules in JavaScript, .NET and PowerShell is to build a fileless module chain on the victim computer consisting of an initial small runner and several Windows system registry values containing the encrypted remote administration tool. The tool does all that a typical Trojan needs to accomplish: upload, download and execute files, fingerprint target systems.

The resulting file appears as a shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an optional arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world. The archive contains four files - 1. gnome-shell-ext – the spy agent executable 2. gnome-shell-ext.sh – checks if gnome-shell-ext is already running and if not, executes it 3. rtp.dat – configuration file for gnome-shell-ext 4. setup.sh – the setup script that is run by makeself after unpacking. The setup script installs the agent to ~/.cache/gnome-software/gnome-shell-extensions/, in an attempt to masquerade itself as a Gnome shell extension. Gnome shell extensions allow tweaking the Gnome desktop and add functionalities. They are the desktop equivalent to browser extensions. Persistence is achieved by registering gnome-shell-ext.sh to run every minute in crontab. Finally, the script executes gnome-shell-ext.sh, which in turn launches the main executable gnome-shell-ext.",

In the first, the attacker sends a local file which will be executed on the victim machine with a given command line argument. In the 2nd mode, the attacker runs an arbitrary shell command without the need to send an actual file. These functionalities are supported in both 32 and 64 bit versions. According to Symantec, the 64 bit versions were leveraged solely for executing shell commands, mostly to generate new user accounts in the victim environments.",
