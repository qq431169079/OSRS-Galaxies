She Googled how to bypass them and found that you could use default credentials for the admin accounts in order to bypass them and play games. Since it was easy for her to bypass the school systems, she was excited to keep learning more about hacking. Windows XP was the first target she hacked, followed by the school’s website. She never really found any vulnerabilities, but became excited to find out what web applications were running on them.",
